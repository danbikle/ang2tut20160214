Hello World

The purpose of this repo is to help me understand how to connect Angular2 to Firebase.

The instructions I list below are for Ubuntu but they might work on a Mac.

I prefer to use Ubuntu 14.04 because it runs on both my laptop and on Amazon.

I start by installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop.

The most recent version of Ubuntu which I like is at this URL:

http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.3/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso

The three general paths to install Ubuntu on a laptop are listed below:

- Remove Windows and install Ubuntu
- Ignore Windows and install Ubuntu on USB drive
- Install VirtualBox on Mac or Windows, Install Ubuntu inside VirtualBox

My favorite path is path2: Ignore Windows and install Ubuntu on USB drive.

Path2 works well with a new laptop should I want to maintain the warranty.

If you are new to the world of Ubuntu laptops I suggest you buy a cheap windows laptop from Walmart and run some experiments.

When I install Ubuntu, it will ask who I am.

I tell Ubuntu that my name is ann.

Then, Ubuntu will create an account named ann which has useful privileges.

If you use a different initial account, you should create an account named ann after you boot the laptop.

The shell commands to create the ann account are listed below:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ann
sudo passwd ann
```

The first command creates ann.
The second command gives her a password.
